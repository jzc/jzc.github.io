From Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*, chapter 3.D, exercise 20:

  Suppose :math:`n` is a positive integer and :math:`A_{i,j} \in \mathbb{F}` for 
  :math:`i, j = 1, \dots, n`. Prove that the following are equivalent. 
  (note that in both parts below, the number of equations equals 
  the number of variables):
  
  (a) The trivial solution :math:`x_1 = \dots = x_n = 0` is the only solution to 
  the homogenous system of equations
 
  .. math::
     \begin{aligned}
     \sum^n_{k=1} A_{1,k}x_k&=0\\
     \vdots\\
     \sum^n_{k=1} A_{n,k}x_k&=0.
     \end{aligned}
   
  (b) For every :math:`c_1, \dots, c_n \in \mathbb{F}`, there exists a solution to the system 
  of equations
 
  .. math::
     \begin{aligned}
     \sum^n_{k=1} A_{1,k}x_k&=c_1\\
     \vdots\\
     \sum^n_{k=1} A_{n,k}x_k&=c_n.
     \end{aligned}

The left hand side of both system of equations can be rewritten as the
matrix equation :math:`Ax`, where :math:`A \in \mathbb{F}^{n,n}` and 
:math:`x \in \mathbb{F}^n`. The matrix :math:`A` induces the linear map 
:math:`T_A \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{F}^n)` where :math:`T_A(x) = A x`.

Condition (a) is equivalent to :math:`\text{null } T_A = \{0\}`,
which is equivalent to :math:`T_A` is injective. 
Condition (b) is equivalent to :math:`\text{range } T_A = \mathbb{F^n}`,
which is equivalent to :math:`T_A` is surjective.

Hence, [Axler 3.69] implies that injectivity and surjectivity are 
equivalent for linear operators, and as :math:`T_A \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{F}^n)`,
we have :math:`T_A` injective iff :math:`T_A` surjective. Therefore, (a) and (b) are 
equivalent.
