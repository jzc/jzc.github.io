Hi! My name is Justin, and I am a (recent) former undergrad at 
the University of Colorado Boulder, studying computer science.
My main interests include programming, theoretical computer science, math, 
and computer graphics.

Here are some things to check out:

* `tableau </tableau>`_

* `Computational complexity of problems for deterministic presentations of sofic shifts <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03484>`_

* `active-camo </active-camo>`_

* `symbolic-dynamics <https://symbolic-dynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_: a Python
  package for computations in symbolic dynamics

* `Towards algorithms for reducible presentations of sofic shifts <{static}/static/thesis.pdf>`_ (senior thesis advised by `Rafael Frongillo <https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~raf/>`_)

* `Numerical methods for the Schr√∂dinger equation <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jzc/numerical_methods_for_quantum/blob/master/numerical_methods_for_schrodinger_equation.ipynb>`_
 
* `double-pendulum </double-pendulum>`_
  
* `microbiomes </microbiomes>`_
  
* `Can online self-reports assist in real-time identification of influenza vaccination uptake?
