Hi! My name is Justin, and I am a (recent) former undergrad at 
the University of Colorado Boulder, studying computer science.
My main interests are in theoretical computer science, math, 
and computer graphics. Now, I am preparing to apply for 
grad school in 2021.

Here are some things to check out:
* [Towards algorithms for reducible presentations of sofic shifts](/assets/thesis.pdf) (senior thesis advised by [Rafael Frongillo](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~raf/))
* [Numerical methods for the Schr√∂dinger equation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jzc/numerical_methods_for_quantum/blob/master/numerical_methods_for_schrodinger_equation.ipynb)
* [double-pendulum](/double-pendulum)
* [microbiomes](/microbiomes)
* [Can online self-reports assist in real-time identification of
