title: Trivial solution equivalent to a solution existing
---

From Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*, chapter 3.D, exercise 20:

> Suppose $$n$$ is a positive integer and $$A_{i,j} \in \mathbb{F}$$ for 
> $$i, j = 1, \dots, n$$. Prove that the following are requivalent. 
> (note that in both parts below, the number of equations equals 
> the number of variables):
> 
> (a) The trivial solution $$x_1 = \dots = x_n = 0$$ is the only solution to 
> the homogenous system of equations 
>
> $$
\begin{aligned}
\sum^n_{k=1} A_{1,k}x_k&=0\\
\vdots\\
\sum^n_{k=1} A_{n,k}x_k&=0.
\end{aligned}
> $$
>
> (b) For every $$c_1, \dots, c_n \in \mathbb{F}$$, there exists a solution to the system 
> of equations
>
> $$
\begin{aligned}
\sum^n_{k=1} A_{1,k}x_k&=c_1\\
\vdots\\
\sum^n_{k=1} A_{n,k}x_k&=c_n.
\end{aligned}
> $$

The left hand side of both system of equations can be rewritten as the
matrix equation $$Ax=0$$, where $$A \in \mathbb{F}^{n,n}$$ and 
$$x, 0 \in \mathbb{F}^n$$. The matrix $$A$$ induces the linear map 
$$T_A \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{F}^n)$$ where $$T_A(x) = A x$$.

Condition (a) is equivalent to $$\text{null } T_A = \{0\}$$, which is equivalent to $$T_A$$ is injective. 
Condition (b) is equivalent to $$\text{range } T_A = \mathbb{F^n}$$, which is equivalent to $$T_A$$ is surjective.

Hence, [Axler 3.69] implies that injectivity and surjectivity are 
equivalent for linear operators, and as $$T_A \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{F}^n)$$,
we have $$T_A$$ injective iff $$T_A$$ surjective. Therefore, (a) and (b) are 
equivalent.
